Data Scientist with Python Track on DataCamp

Here is a full repository containing the courses of the "Data Scientist with Python Track" on DataCamp.

This repository will be constantly updated after each course of the track is completed.

Some files, directories, and so on have been left untouched, basically to let others know the progress of the author.

Once this track is completed, other repositories will be created separately with authored projects, if and only if they can be shared.
